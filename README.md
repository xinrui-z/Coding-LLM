# Programming LLM Benchmark: Code Generation & Game Development  

This benchmark evaluates **6 leading programming LLMs** on real-world tasks (frontend development, game design, etc.) Tested models:  
**Qwen3-Coder-Plus, Kimi K2, GLM-4.5, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI o4-mini-high**.  

## Key Findings  

### 🚀 **Code Generation: Domestic Models Shine**  
- **High Completion Rates**: All models (except GLM-4.5 in *Snake Game* logic) delivered functional code for basic tasks.  
- **Design Superiority**: Chinese models (Qwen, GLM, Kimi) outperformed in **UI/UX tasks** (e.g., weather cards, restaurant homepages) with better visuals and dynamic interactions (e.g., countdowns, quote generators).  

### 🎮 **Game Development: Functional but Limited Strategy**  
- **Basic Playability Achieved**: All models implemented core mechanics for *Snake* and *Gomoku* (Five-in-a-Row).  
- **Weak AI Strategy**: Opponent logic (e.g., Gomoku) was often simplistic.  
- **Interaction Highlights**:  
  - Kimi/Claude: Added *pause functionality*.  
  - Qwen: Offered *undo moves* for better usability.
